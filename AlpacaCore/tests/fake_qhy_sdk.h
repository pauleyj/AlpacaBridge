/**
 * Scripted fake for the QHYSDK seam (issue #321).
 *
 * QHY is the one vendor whose real SDK cannot run at all on a test runner:
 * the first libqhyccd call spawns PnpEventListenerThread, which segfaults in
 * libusb_hotplug_register_callback when libusb_init failed. Before this fake
 * the QHY drivers had NO automated connect coverage of any kind — neither
 * test_qhy_camera.cpp nor test_qhy_filterwheel.cpp ever reached
 * set_connected(true).
 *
 * Capabilities:
 * - Fault injection: add a method name to `throw_from` and that call throws
 *   AlpacaException(DriverException).
 * - `sdk_resource_available = false` makes the three resource-dependent entry
 *   points (enumerate_cameras, get_camera_model, open_camera) throw the
 *   wrapper's "QHY SDK resource not initialized" DriverException — the path
 *   that on real hardware can only be reached by crashing.
 * - Canned devices: fill `cameras`; enumeration returns them verbatim and
 *   opens resolve ids against them.
 * - Ref-counted opens per camera_id, matching the wrapper's open_count: the
 *   camera driver and the CFW driver share ONE handle for one physical
 *   device. `physical_opens`/`physical_closes` count real transitions;
 *   `underflow_closes` counts closes of a camera that was not open (must stay
 *   0 in a correct driver).
 * - Scripted wheel positions: `cfw_position_script` is consumed one read at a
 *   time (last value repeats), so a homing/transit sequence is testable. -1
 *   means "still moving", matching GetQHYCCDCFWStatus.
 *
 * TWO RULES THIS FAKE MUST KEEP (they are not stylistic):
 *
 * 1. NOTHING HERE MAY BLOCK. The camera driver's exposure, temperature,
 *    cooler-off and telemetry workers join with a bounded timeout and DETACH
 *    on expiry (telemetry since issue #323, so the rule is load-bearing for
 *    it too), and its pulse-guide worker is detached by design. A fake that blocks turns
 *    those into detached threads still calling into it after the test body
 *    has moved on — i.e. a use-after-free of the fake itself. The ONE
 *    sanctioned exception is `before_call`, null in every ordinary test: a
 *    case that sets it to block a named method owns the consequences and
 *    must release the block before its driver is destroyed (the three #339
 *    cases). LockedQHYSDK::slowest_call_ms() is the mechanical check that no
 *    method has quietly gained a block; the 26-forward sweep asserts it.
 * 2. THE FAKE MUST OUTLIVE EVERY DRIVER BUILT ON IT, including those
 *    detachable workers, which reach the SDK through a captured QHYSDK*
 *    rather than through the driver's `sdk_` member. (All but pulse-guide
 *    still capture `this` too and touch it after the SDK call returns, so
 *    they are not safe to outlive the driver either -- the capture narrows
 *    that window, it does not remove it.) Declare the fake before the driver
 *    (locals destroy in reverse order); never stash a driver beyond the
 *    fake's scope. QHYSeamFixture (locked_qhy_sdk.h, #338) owns fake,
 *    decorator and driver in that order so a case cannot get this wrong.
 *
 * default_camera() reports NO cooler. That is deliberate: has_cooler starts
 * the driver's telemetry thread, which is a second thread calling into this
 * fake for the life of the connection (its disconnect is fast since issue
 * #323, when the poll's sleep became an interruptible wait, so the old
 * "blocks up to ~1 s per disconnect" reason is gone). Use
 * default_cooled_camera() when the thermal paths are what's under test, so
 * the cases that don't need them keep to one thread.
 *
 * KNOWN PARITY GAPS — places this fake is deliberately WEAKER than the real
 * wrapper, so a test passing here would not have caught a regression in the
 * corresponding real guard. Each is tracked, and the [stress] follow-up (#321)
 * will exercise them all. One IS relied on: the two binning cases call
 * set_bin_mode() and assert get_mem_length() does not shrink further, so the
 * #365 residual below is load-bearing for them -- making get_mem_length() read
 * wbin_/hbin_ would fail those cases, which is the protection wanted, but it
 * means closing #365 is not free:
 *
 * - set_bin_mode()'s wbin_/hbin_ are WRITE-ONLY: nothing reads them, so a bin
 *   change on its own never moves get_mem_length(). Under the ROI UNITS
 *   convention below that is correct for how the driver drives this fake --
 *   it always pairs a bin change with a set_resolution() carrying the binned
 *   size -- but a test that calls set_bin_mode() alone and expects the length
 *   to shrink, the way the real GetQHYCCDMemLength() does after
 *   SetQHYCCDBinMode, will not see it. Tracked in issue #365.
 * - set_readout_mode() does not re-run init_camera() the way the real one
 *   re-invokes InitQHYCCD, so any init_calls assertion around a mode switch
 *   reads differently here than on hardware. Tracked in issue #335.
 * - get_chip_info() derives has_cooler/is_color/bayer_pattern/has_st4_port/
 *   has_shutter from the canned QHYCameraInfo, where the real one derives all
 *   five from IsQHYCCDControlAvailable. So steering a capability by
 *   adding/removing control::COOLER from `controls_available` has NO effect
 *   here, while the same change on hardware would flip has_cooler. Set the
 *   struct field (or use default_cooled_camera()) instead. Tracked in
 *   issue #337.
 *
 * ROI UNITS — `roi_` is in BINNED pixels, matching the only caller: the driver
 * passes max_width / bin_x to set_resolution() from set_bin_locked(), and
 * ASCOM NumX/NumY (already binned) from start_exposure(). So get_mem_length()
 * shrinks with the binning because the ROI shrinks, NOT by dividing again --
 * doing both would report a quarter of the bytes the SDK owes for the frame it
 * is about to deliver. get_mem_length() and get_single_frame() must agree:
 * hardware cannot deliver an image larger than GetQHYCCDMemLength(), and the
 * "get_single_frame never exceeds get_mem_length" case pins the pair at bin > 1.
 *
 * FIXED since this list was written, kept named so a reader chasing an old
 * comment lands somewhere: get_param() now answers the QHYCCD_ERROR sentinel,
 * not 0.0, for a control missing from `params` (issue #373); and control_temp() now
 * approaches its target by `temp_settle_step_c` per call rather than settling
 * instantly, the way ControlQHYCCDTemp's PID does (issue #390).
 *
 * Not thread-hardened, by design — wrap it in LockedQHYSDK for the [stress]
 * suite so ThreadSanitizer reports point at driver code, not at this file.

    // worker is running concurrently with that read.
    //
    // Sound for every case in these files today, though the reason is not
    // simply "no cooled cameras" -- test_qhy_fake_sdk.cpp has one, the
    // control_temp convergence case, which reads last_temp_target straight
    // from the test body, and since open-astro#323 test_qhy_camera.cpp has
    // cooled cases (the two disconnect-timing cases) that connect a cooled
    // camera, which spawns BOTH the telemetry and the temperature worker.
    // What keeps every read safe is that NO OTHER THREAD is touching the
    // fake at the moment the test body reads: the fake-only file's two cases
    // that do spawn std::threads (the LockedQHYSDK slowest-forward and
    // cancel-overtake cases) join them before anything is read, and its
    // QHYSeamFixture case builds a CameraDriver but connects an uncooled
    // camera and never starts an exposure, so no worker exists before
    // physical_opens is read; the wheel file and the uncooled camera cases
    // build drivers but never start a background worker (their two
    // start_exposure() calls only assert a throw); and the RULE for a cooled
    // case, which every one of them follows, is that its body reads no fake
    // field at all and its workers are joined by the disconnect it measures
    // before the driver is destroyed. A new cooled case that wants to read a
    // counter afterwards must disconnect first, or route the read through
    // the lock.
    //
    // THE FIRST case that reads one of these fields while a driver worker is
    // still running breaks that -- a connected cooled camera whose body then
    // reads a counter, a real exposure in flight, a pulse guide -- and the
    // read becomes a TSan finding in test code, exactly the noise LockedQHYSDK
    // exists to keep out of the [stress] suite. Route them through the same
    // lock before adding such a case. Tracked in issue #331.
    //
    // The same issue covers the mirror-image race on the input side: hit()
    // bumps `calls` under calls_mutex but then reads `throw_from` outside it,
    // so a test body that arms or clears fault injection mid-storm races the
    // call path reading it. Sound today for the same reason (nothing else is
    // calling into the fake while the body writes it) and unsound from the
    // same first case, so fix both together rather than one at a time.
