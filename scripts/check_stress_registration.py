"""Fail on [stress] tag mistakes: missing vendor coverage, and misplaced tags.

Five rule families, not one:

1. Every vendor (driver, device type) pair needs a `[stress]` TEST_CASE (the
   ALLOWLIST covers only the drivers that predate this gate, and /driver-build
   Step 7b is where a new driver gets its seam and registration).
2. A `[stress-guard]`-without-`[stress]` case inside a `*_concurrency_stress.cpp`
   file is rejected: that tag is for harness self-tests, and a registration
   wearing it would read as registered while dropping out of the vendor count.
3. A `[stress]` case anywhere else under `AlpacaCore/tests/` is rejected: such
   a file can compile unconditionally, and one case alone then satisfies the
   TSan job's vendor zero-coverage grep and makes it vacuous. The scope is that
   directory deliberately -- `alpacacore_tests` is the only binary CI runs a
   tag filter against.
4. A registration file must be listed inside an `if(TARGET ...)` block in
   `AlpacaCore/tests/CMakeLists.txt`. Rule 3 assumes every `[stress]` case is
   in a conditionally-compiled file; this is the other half of that assumption
   (issue #396), and without it appending a correctly-named, correctly-tagged
   registration to the unconditional `TEST_SOURCES` list passes every other
   rule while making the TSan zero-test grep vacuous again.
5. A registration file must use `StressCallGuard` the way AGENTS.md documents
   it (issues #379, #334), or be named in `GUARD_ALLOWLIST` with a reason:
   the guard present, `CHECK(...unexpected_count())`, `INFO(...report())`,
   `CHECK(...total_calls() > 0)` (the comparison is part of the rule: `>= 0`
   is the same vacuity), and no local `call()` helper in either of the
   two forms this repo has used (a file-scope function/template, or an
   `auto call = [...]` lambda). A stale allow-list entry is itself a failure.
   See check_guard_usage().

Rules 1-3 and 5 read C++ with the comments stripped (issue #386), so an illustrative
case macro in a doc comment -- `concurrency_stress.h` is the documentation hub
for this pattern -- is documentation, not a registration. String literals are
deliberately NOT stripped. The scans also cover every Catch2 registration
macro, not just `TEST_CASE`, and join adjacent tag literals the way the
preprocessor does (issue #393).


AGENTS.md requires every new or substantially-changed driver to register a
`[stress]` TEST_CASE with the ThreadSanitizer concurrency suite
(`AlpacaCore/tests/concurrency_stress.h`, wired into the `sanitizers-tsan` CI
job). Registration is manual today, and nothing failed when it was skipped.

Run from the repo root:  python3 scripts/check_stress_registration.py
Regex regression guard (no repo state needed):  python3 scripts/check_stress_registration.py --self-test

Coverage is tracked per (vendor, Alpaca device type) pair, not per vendor.
A vendor-level check (does `test_<vendor>_concurrency_stress.cpp` exist at
all?) would pass ZWO or ToupTek in full the moment any one of their drivers
is registered -- while the ZWO rotator, focuser and dew-heater switch
and the ToupTek focuser were still unregistered, that would have hidden
them behind a green check. Keying on device type as well catches those.

Known gap: the pair is the finest key the gate has, so a registered driver
masks every other driver of the same vendor and type. The two ZWO ASIAIR
switch drivers (`zwo_asiair_switch_driver.cpp`, `zwo_asiair_plus_switch_driver.cpp`,
libgpiod, no fake seam) have no [stress] case and are hidden behind the ZWO
dew-heater switch registration; they are covered by code review only.
Same shape for (gemini, covercalibrator): only Flat Panel Pro
(GeminiFlatPanelV2Driver, gemini_flatpanel_driver.cpp) is stormed, but that
also marks the Cover Lite class (GeminiFlatPanelDriver, same file, its own
set_connected/calibrator implementation, no task threads) and the Rev2
model path as covered; both are code-review only, not exercised. And for
(qhy, filterwheel): the standalone QHYCFW3 USB driver
(qhy_cfw3_filterwheel_driver.cpp, over its pty fake) is the registration,
which also marks the integrated CFW driver (qhy_filterwheel_driver.cpp, over
the camera handle) as covered; that one has fake-SDK unit cases but no storm.

The device type for a driver file is read from its own
`get_device_type() const override { return DeviceType::X; }` rather than
guessed from the filename: `gemini_flatpanel_driver.cpp` actually returns
DeviceType::CoverCalibrator, so a filename-based guess would be wrong.

New driver, no stress test yet? Either add the `[stress]` TEST_CASE in a
`*_concurrency_stress.cpp` file gated behind the vendor's `if(TARGET ...)`
block (see `test_touptek_concurrency_stress.cpp` for the shape: one factory +
one operate callback). ALLOWLIST below is only for the drivers that predate
this gate: it is meant to shrink, not grow, and a new driver has no business
on it (/driver-build Step 7b says how to build the seam and the registration).
An entry left in place after coverage is added will itself fail the check
(see below), so there is nothing to remember to clean up by hand.

    """StressCallGuard is used, and its result is actually asserted (issue #379),
    scoped to each TEST_CASE that constructs one (issue #514) -- AGENTS.md
    states the closing idiom as ending THE TEST_CASE, not the file, and a
    file-wide presence check let one fully-guarded case cover for every other
    case in the same file that dropped the closing lines: #468 emptied
    GUARD_ALLOWLIST, and files with many [stress] cases (the ToupTek and ZWO
    concurrency-stress files, 14 and 13 cases respectively) could have
    silently dropped the guard from all but one case with this gate still
    green.

    Three failure modes, in increasing order of how convincing they look:

    1. No guard at all in the whole file. run_lifecycle_stress swallows
       exceptions in its own outer catch, so the storm passes no matter what
       the driver threw. This one rule stays file-scoped: GUARD_ALLOWLIST is
       an opt-out for a whole file that predates the guard, not for individual
       cases within an otherwise-migrated file.
    2. A guard constructed in a TEST_CASE, but that same case's closing CHECK
       omitted. Worse than (1): the file LOOKS like it follows the documented
       pattern, and a reader scanning for StressCallGuard concludes every
       case's calls are checked.
    3. The CHECK present but INFO(report()) missing, so a real finding arrives
       as a bare `0 == 1` naming nothing it swallowed.

    Plus the vacuity hole (issue #334): unexpected_count() == 0 passes when the
    callback never ran at all, so a storm that silently stopped exercising the
    driver still reports a pass. total_calls() > 0 is what closes it.

    A local `call(...)` helper that wraps the same try/catch by hand is
    rejected outright: it is the shape the guard replaced, and it reintroduces
    the counting-without-failing problem one file at a time. Both forms the
    merged registrations used are caught: the file-scope function/template
    (`static void call(...)`, `template <...> void call(...)`) and the lambda
    (`auto call = [](auto&& fn) {...}`), which was three of the five (the other two were templates).
    This one also stays file-scoped -- a helper can be defined once and used
    from several TEST_CASEs, so per-case scoping would miss every use site but
    the first.

    Reads the comment-stripped text, like rules 1-3: a closing CHECK that has
    been commented out must not satisfy the presence rules.
