## General Notes

- **ConformU Verification**: All drivers listed below have been tested and verified using the ConformU tool to ensure full compliance with the ASCOM Alpaca API specification.
- **Driver Status**: Only drivers that have been verified with ConformU are listed. Additional drivers may be in development but are not included until they pass ConformU verification.
- **Adding New Drivers**: New driver support can be added by implementing the appropriate driver interface. See the [Development Guide](docs/development.md) for details. All drivers must pass ConformU verification before being added to this list.

- **Connection Types**:
  - **Ethernet**: Network-based connection (TCP/IP)
  - **USB/Serial**: USB-to-serial adapter or direct serial connection

- **Linux Notes**:
  - **Debian 13 (Trixie) on arm64**: AlpacaBridge is built and validated on arm64 only (Raspberry Pi 3B+/4/5, Rockchip SBCs, OrangePi, iOptron iMate). All drivers have been tested using Debian 13 on arm64 with ConformU v4.2.1 (original drivers), v4.3.0, v4.4.0, v4.5.0 (see the timing caveat below — treat its timing records as suspect), or v4.5.1 (newer drivers). As new ConformU versions are released this will be adjusted.
  - **Avoid ConformU 4.5.0 on arm64**: that release was published without `PublishReadyToRun`, causing spurious "OUTSIDE FAST RESPONSE TIME TARGET" failures on the first Camera-device member of each response type (`CameraState`, `CameraXSize`, `SensorType`) — reproducible on this rig with every vendor's camera driver tried (ToupTek and ZWO), not a real regression. Treat **every** 4.5.0 timing record in this file as suspect -- there are a dozen and more, across cameras, wheels, focusers and mounts, so no list here would stay honest. They all predate the JIT cost being understood, and a clean timing result on 4.5.0 is not evidence of a real pass -- it usually means the first-use penalty had already been paid earlier in the same process, and for some member types (the enum-typed mount members) a warm re-run does not clear it at all. Their error and issue counts stand; only the timing verdicts are in doubt, and re-validation on 4.5.1 is what settles one. Fixed upstream in 4.5.1 ([ConformU#31](https://github.com/ASCOMInitiative/ConformU/issues/31)); until a formal 4.5.1 GitHub release exists, get it from `https://download.ascom-standards.org/beta/conformu.linux-arm64.tar.xz`.
  - **Kernel 6.12.75-v8-16+ or higher.**: Note: kernel 6.12.75-v8-16+ is required to ensure ZWO EAF/EFW hardware compatibility. Without it, devices besides ZWO may or may not be recognized. Please check the kernel version.

- **Wi-Fi / Mount Notes**:
  - **Debian 13 (Trixie)**: Wi-Fi has been tested from Raspberry Pi to the mount. Due to the limited Wi-Fi power management on the Raspberry Pi, it is highly recommended to disable low power mode if you opt to connect via Wi-Fi to the mount. A USB connection to the mount is recommended when possible, as commands are much quicker and more reliable.

<summary><strong>GPhoto Camera Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **SDK**: libgphoto2/libraw (system packages via pkg-config, no vendored SDK — the only camera vendor here built on open-source system libraries rather than a proprietary `.so`/`.a`).
- **Connection**: USB (PTP). Cameras enumerate by USB autodetect index (`cameraIndex`), same convention as ZWO/QHY/SVBONY/PlayerOne/ToupTek.
- **Coverage**: any Canon/Nikon/Sony body libgphoto2 recognizes over PTP should work, since the driver talks the generic PTP capture/config protocol rather than a per-model SDK. Sensor geometry (CameraXSize/CameraYSize/BayerOffsetX/Y/MaxADU) is learned from a real decoded RAW frame the first time a given model connects on a rig, then cached — see `.github/instructions/gphoto.instructions.md`. Confirmed generalizing across models on the same rig: the D3200's real RAW crop (6034x4012) and 12-bit ADC (MaxADU 4095) were both learned automatically and differ from the D5300's (6016x4016, MaxADU 16383) with no code or config change, just swapping the physical camera; the D3300 then primed as the D5300's crop (6016x4016) with the D3200's 12-bit MaxADU (4095), a third combination learned the same way. `PixelSizeX`/`PixelSizeY` come from a static per-model table (~140 interchangeable-lens Nikon/Canon bodies); any other model, including every fixed-lens compact/camcorder libgphoto2 also supports, reports 0 (ASCOM "unknown").
- **ISO modeled as Gain Index, not Gain Value**: unlike every other camera driver here, ISO is a discrete `Gains()` list (the camera's actual ISO choices) rather than a continuous register, since that is what a DSLR's hardware actually offers. `GainMin`/`GainMax` correctly throw `PropertyNotImplemented`.
- **Tested models**: Canon EOS 4000D (first Canon body; reported by a user on a Raspberry Pi 5, Debian 13, libgphoto2 2.5.31, AlpacaBridge 4.0.0, issue #611: 5202x3464, MaxADU 16383, 4.3 micron pixels), Canon EOS 70D (its own Raspberry Pi 5, Debian 13, libgphoto2 2.5.31, AlpacaBridge 4.0.0 built from main `2f0c8338`, issue #637: 5496x3670, MaxADU 15303, 4.1 micron pixels) and Canon EOS 250D (sold as the EOS 200D II in Asia; the same Raspberry Pi 5 and build: 6024x4020, MaxADU 16383, 3.72 micron pixels). The 70D reports `ExposureMax` 30 s because it exposes no standalone `bulb` widget, and it needs the mode dial on M: on B the shutter-speed list is empty and `StartExposure` fails with "No shutter speed control exposed by this camera". Decoding its 20 MP CR2 takes about 4 s on a Raspberry Pi 3 (about 8 s per frame end to end, against about 4 s on a Pi 5), which makes ConformU's `StartExposure` wait time out there, so do not validate DSLRs on a Pi 3 (only the Pi 3 and Pi 5 were run on this body). The 250D needs the lens on MF: with AF the geometry priming capture and every exposure fail with `gp_camera_capture failed: Unspecified error` and no frame arrives. Nikon D5300, Nikon D3200 and Nikon D3300 were run on Linux arm64 (USB), same rig, same AlpacaBridge device slot -- swapped without reconfiguration. The D3300 primed as 6016x4016, MaxADU 4095, 3.92 micron pixels (libgphoto2 2.5.31, AlpacaBridge 4.0.0). Bulb exposures (anything past the body's 30 s native ceiling) validated on the D3300: 60 s and 300 s frames through the Alpaca API on the OpenAstro ASIAIR Pro image (issue #569). Camera-side settings for bulb: mode dial M, shutter speed Bulb, lens on MF, Long exposure NR Off.
- **ConformU**: 4.5.1 — 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues on every model in the table above.

### iOptron

| Model Series | Connection | Linux<br>(arm64) | Status |
|--------------|------------|------------------|--------|
| iCAM178M | USB | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/iOptron/iCAM178M/) |
| iCAM462C | USB | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/iOptron/iCAM462C/) |
| iCAM464C | USB | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/iOptron/iCAM464C/) |

<details>
<summary><strong>iOptron Camera Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Backend**: the iCAM cameras are rebadged Player One cameras (iCAM178M = USB `a0a0:178b`, iCAM462C = `a0a0:462a`, iCAM464C = `a0a0:464a`; the Player One SDK enumerates them by their iCAM names). It is served by the Player One camera driver (Player One Camera SDK v3.10.0) and needs the `ALPACACORE_ENABLE_PLAYERONE` build flag; iOptron publishes no camera SDK.
- **Configuration**: select vendor iOptron, device type Camera, and the Player One SDK camera index. The index is shared with any Player One-branded cameras on the same system.
- **Behavior**: identical to the Player One camera driver (see Player One Driver Notes below), including dew heater and fan Actions on cooled models.
- **Validated**: ConformU 4.5.0 on iCAM178M (mono), iCAM462C (color, RGGB) and iCAM464C (color) hardware (Raspberry Pi, Linux arm64, 2026-08-26): 0 errors, 0 issues, all members within timing targets on all three.
- **USB link health matters**: a marginal cable/port shows up as `libusb: error [op_set_configuration] failed, error -1 errno 71` in the server log, and the camera then answers with a -300 CCDTemperature, fails PulseGuide (`POASetConfig(bool): operation failed`) and never delivers a frame before dropping off the bus. Re-seat the camera on a direct USB 3 port with a known-good cable; the driver is not at fault. Cold ConformU processes on the Pi show ~0.1-0.16 s first-use marks on enum-typed members (CameraState, SensorType); these are ConformU-side JIT, not the driver, and a warm re-run in the same session is clean.
- **Verified OS/Architecture**: Linux arm64 (Raspberry Pi).

### Player One

| Model Series | Connection | Linux<br>(arm64) | Status |
|--------------|------------|------------------|--------|
| Ceres 462M | USB | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/Player%20One/Ceres%20462M/) |
| Uranus-C PRO | USB | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/Player%20One/Uranus-C%20PRO/) |
| Mars-C II | USB | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/Player%20One/Mars-C%20II/) |

<details>
<summary><strong>Player One Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **SDK**: Player One Camera SDK v3.10.0 (build target)
- **Connection**: USB (requires udev rules `99-player_one_astronomy.rules`)
- **Tested models**: Ceres 462M (uncooled), Mars-C II (uncooled guide camera, IMX290), and Uranus-C PRO (cooled, IMX585) on Linux arm64.
- **Cooling (TEC)**: Capability-gated on the SDK's `POA_COOLER` / `POA_TARGET_TEMP` config attributes. Uncooled cameras report `CanSetCCDTemperature = false` and `CanGetCoolerPower = false`. Cooler control (`CoolerOn`, `SetCCDTemperature`, `CoolerPower`) validated on Uranus-C PRO hardware: reaches and holds the target temperature with closed-loop power regulation.
- **Dew Heater / Fan**: Cooled models expose the lens heater and radiator fan two ways — camera custom Actions (`GetHeaterPower`/`SetHeaterPower`/`GetFanPower`/`SetFanPower`, percent) and the **Player One Thermal Switch** device (see Switch Drivers below) for slider control in clients like NINA. Both are runtime-only by design; no setting persists across connects. Note the fan does not auto-vary with temperature — `CoolerOn` turns cooler + fan on and the fan runs at its set power.
- **Pulse guiding**: Capability-gated on `isHasST4Port`. Driver times the pulse duration via `POA_GUIDE_NORTH/SOUTH/EAST/WEST` bool toggles.

### QHY

| QHY5III585M | USB | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/QHY/QHY5III585M/) |

<details>
<summary><strong>QHY Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **SDK**: QHY CCD SDK 26.06.04.16 (build target)
- **Connection**: USB (requires udev rules and firmware; see below)
- **Cooler power**: `CanGetCoolerPower` returns false; cooler power reporting is not implemented to avoid SDK timeouts.
- **PulseGuide**: runs the SDK guide call on a detached thread so the initiator returns immediately (ControlQHYCCDGuide blocks for the full pulse duration on real hardware).
- **Cooler/temp SDK calls**: `ControlQHYCCDTemp` and `SetQHYCCDParam` have no SDK-side timeout and can occasionally run well past their typical duration on real hardware. The driver bounds how long disconnect waits on their background workers and detaches rather than blocking indefinitely; the QHY SDK handle is reference-counted so a detached worker can never use a handle after it's been closed.
- **Fixed — Readout mode "Linearity HDR" (index 1) used to take ~60-75s per frame regardless of exposure duration; now completes in under a second, same as "Full Resolution".** Root cause (found 2026-08-12, confirmed A/B/A across three back-to-back runs on real miniCam8M hardware): `SetQHYCCDReadMode()` must be called **before** `InitQHYCCD()` for the slow-mode download to run at full speed — QHY's own official `VS2022_Basic_Single` Windows sample does exactly this (`SetQHYCCDReadMode` is the very first call after `OpenQHYCCD`, ahead of `SetQHYCCDStreamMode`/`InitQHYCCD`), but every client examined during the investigation (this driver, standalone repros, and INDIGO's independent `ccd_qhy`/`ccd_qhy2` driver on both its current and historical 2.0.0.23 release) calls `SetQHYCCDReadMode` well after the handle's initial `InitQHYCCD`, since the read mode is a client-driven property set after connect, not a fixed startup choice. The fix does not require closing/reopening the handle (which is unsafe here — it's shared with the CFW driver via ref-counting): `QHYSDKWrapper::set_readout_mode()` simply re-invokes `InitQHYCCD()` on the same already-open handle immediately after `SetQHYCCDReadMode()`, which reproduces the fast path exactly. Before landing on this, the investigation ruled out SDK version (3 builds), `CONTROL_USBTRAFFIC`/`CONTROL_SPEED`, a background warm-up capture, and `GetQHYCCDEffectiveArea` — none of those made any difference, confirming the pacing was never actually about the download itself, only about the ordering of the mode switch relative to `InitQHYCCD`.
- **Known SDK/firmware limitation — Gain and Offset cannot be changed while readout mode "Linearity HDR" (index 1) is active.** `SetQHYCCDParam(CONTROL_GAIN/OFFSET, ...)` returns success but the value silently never changes (confirmed stuck at fixed values, e.g. Gain 9 / Offset 100, regardless of what's requested) while in this mode — likely because HDR combines multiple internal capture stages that need fixed gain/offset, and the SDK doesn't surface that as an error. This is pre-existing behavior, not caused by the `InitQHYCCD` re-run above: confirmed identically with the driver's original single-`InitQHYCCD` call order (no re-init involved) and with a full `CloseQHYCCD`+`OpenQHYCCD` cycle, so no available driver-side workaround changes it. `set_readout_mode()` re-pushes the client's last-set Gain/Offset after every mode switch on a best-effort basis (correctly restores them when switching between modes that DO honor the write; harmlessly no-ops while landing in/staying in HDR mode, matching the SDK's own silent-ignore behavior).
- **Filter wheel calls block for up to ~64s during a concurrent camera exposure/download (intentional trade-off).** `move_cfw()`/`get_cfw_position()` share the same per-handle `call_mutex` that a camera download holds for its whole duration on the miniCam8M's integrated CFW (they're the same physical USB handle). Un-serializing them would restore fast CFW polling during an exposure, but would also reopen the exact hang the shared mutex exists to prevent — a concurrent CFW call on a wedged handle hanging forever instead of queuing behind a bounded (if slow) download. A physically desirable filter move never happens mid-exposure anyway; a `Position` poll during a long download stalling instead of returning instantly is the accepted cost. The same `call_mutex` hold also covers `set_readout_mode()`'s re-`InitQHYCCD()` (sub-second in practice — mode set + gain/offset re-push + chip-info refresh, nothing like a full download), so a CFW call issued during a readout-mode switch queues behind it too, on the same accepted trade-off; not separately reproduced against a physical CFW move in flight, but bounded by the same reasoning.
- **Reconnecting refuses to proceed while a prior exposure worker might still be wedged, rather than risking a second physical handle.** If a download's `join_exposure_thread()` timed out (2s) and detached rather than joined, the worker can still be alive inside `GetQHYCCDSingleFrame` when a client later disconnects and reconnects. `disconnect()`'s `close_camera()` call erases the SDK wrapper's handle-map entry regardless, and `open_camera()` only reuses a handle while that entry survives — so a bare reconnect would otherwise `OpenQHYCCD()` a second, independent handle to the same physical USB device while the zombie's own handle might still be in flight. `connect()` now checks `exposure_thread_running_` first and throws a clear "still finishing" error instead; the client can retry once the zombie's blocking call eventually returns (or the process needs a restart, same ceiling as every other reap path in this driver).
- **Exposure watchdog's buffer-size-derived deadline extension only applies to readout modes other than index 0.** Index 0 ("Full Resolution") is the SDK's fast/default mode on every QHY camera examined so far and its transfers complete in a few seconds; extending its watchdog deadline using the same buffer-size floor as HDR-style modes would only delay detecting a genuine hang on it (e.g. a 36MB buffer would otherwise compute an ~87s floor, versus the flat 60s margin that already covers that mode).
- **Tested model**: miniCam8M on Linux arm64
- **Tested model**: QHY5III585M on Linux arm64
- **ConformU**: 4.5.0 (miniCam8M) / 4.5.1 (QHY5III585M) — 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues

### SVBONY

|--------------|------------|------------------|--------|
| SV905C2 | USB | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/SVBONY/SV905C2/) |

| SC571CC | USB | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/SVBONY/SC571CC/) |

<details>
<summary><strong>SVBONY Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **SDK**: SVBONY Camera SDK v1.13.4 (build target) 
- **Connection**: USB (requires udev rules `90-ckusb.rules`)
- **SC715C backend**: the SC715C is a rebadged **ToupTek G3M715C** (same sensor/hardware) and is NOT recognized by the SVBONY SDK. It is served by the ToupTek camera driver (ToupTek toupcamsdk) and needs the `ALPACACORE_ENABLE_TOUPTEK` build flag — select vendor **ToupTek**, not SVBONY, in the web UI; the ToupTek SDK enumerates it under its native name `G3M715C`. Same rebadge pattern as the iOptron iCAM cameras above (rebadged Player One hardware), except that the router aliases vendor `ioptron` + camera onto the Player One driver, so iCAM owners still select `ioptron`. SVBONY has its own driver and no such alias, which is why the SC715C must be configured as ToupTek.
- **SC715C validated**: ConformU 4.5.1 on Linux arm64, 2026-09-11: 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues. (Note: ConformU 4.5.0 on arm64 has a known timing-report bug unrelated to any driver — see General Notes above.)
- **SC571CC backend**: the SC571CC is a rebadged **ToupTek ATR2600C** (cooled color, IMX571 — the color counterpart of the ATR2600M below, same sensor/hardware) and is NOT recognized by the SVBONY SDK. It is served by the ToupTek camera driver and needs the `ALPACACORE_ENABLE_TOUPTEK` build flag — select vendor **ToupTek**, not SVBONY, in the web UI. Unlike the SC715C, the ToupTek SDK enumerates this one under its SVBONY badge name `SC571CC`, not as `ATR2600C`. Same rebadge pattern as the SC715C above.
- **SC571CC validated**: ConformU 4.5.1 on Linux arm64, 2026-09-13: 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues.

<summary><strong>ToupTek Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **SDK**: ToupTek toupcamsdk 2026-01-28 (build target)
- **Connection**: USB (self-contained `libtoupcam.so`; no libusb/libudev link dependency)
- **Tested models**: GPCMOS01200KPF and GPCMOS02000KPA (guide cameras), ATR2600M (cooled APS-C mono, IMX571), ATR2600C (cooled APS-C color, IMX571, sold rebadged as the SVBONY SC571CC), ATR585M (cooled mono, IMX585, HCG/LCG/HDR readout modes) and GPM662M (uncooled mono, IMX662, HCG/LCG readout modes) — all ConformU-validated on Linux arm64. G3M715C (also sold rebadged as SVBONY SC715C — see the SVBONY section) is validated too. Other ToupTek models sharing the same SDK are expected to work but have not been individually verified.
- **ConformU**: 4.3.0 — ATR2600M: 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues (SDK 59.30701.20260128). 4.5.0 — GPM662M (Raspberry Pi, 2026-08-26): 0 errors, 0 issues, all members within timing targets. 4.5.1 — G3M715C (sold as the SVBONY SC715C, 2026-09-11): 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues; report under `AlpacaCore/conformu/SVBONY/SC715C/`. 4.5.1 — ATR2600C (sold as the SVBONY SC571CC, 2026-09-13): 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues; report under `AlpacaCore/conformu/SVBONY/SC571CC/`.
- **Cooling (TEC)**: Capability-gated on `TOUPCAM_FLAG_TEC` / `TOUPCAM_FLAG_TEC_ONOFF`. Uncooled cameras report `CanSetCCDTemperature = false`. On cooled models (ATR2600M) `CoolerOn` / `SetCCDTemperature` / `CoolerPower` drive the TEC; verified reaching −10 °C on hardware.
- **Readout modes (conversion gain + High Full Well)**: on sensors that support them, ASCOM `ReadoutModes` exposes the conversion-gain (`HCG` / `LCG`, plus `HDR` on HDR-capable models) and `High Full Well` hardware modes as a dropdown (e.g. NINA). On the IMX571 these trade read-noise vs full-well (HCG = low noise; LCG / High Full Well = larger full well, ~51 ke⁻ → ~100 ke⁻). Sensors without these keep a single `Normal` mode.
- **Offset**: exposed as ASCOM `Offset` (black level, `TOUPCAM_OPTION_BLACKLEVEL`) on cameras reporting `TOUPCAM_FLAG_BLACKLEVEL`; `OffsetMax` scales with the output bit depth. Cameras without it report `PropertyNotImplemented`.
- **Dew heater / fan / tail LED**: cooled cameras expose an anti-fog dew heater, radiator fan, and the tail indicator LED through the **ToupTek Thermal Switch** device (see Switch Drivers) — `switchType: thermal`, bound by `cameraIndex`, sharing the camera's SDK handle so it runs alongside the camera. Elements are capability-probed per model.
- **Binning**: 1×/2×/3×/4×. Odd bin factors need an even sensor-ROI span, which the driver handles by padding the ROI to even (the SDK floor-bins it back to the requested pixel count).
- **FullWellCapacity**: reported as the ADU saturation value; the true electron full well is a sensor-datasheet figure the SDK does not expose (see readout modes above for the ~51 ke⁻ / ~100 ke⁻ IMX571 modes).

<summary><strong>Gemini CoverCalibrator Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Protocol**: reverse-engineered from the vendor's Windows control app (no SDK or published spec). ASCII commands `">X#"`/`">Xnnn#"`, 9600 baud 8N1. Replies are `"*"` + echoed command letter + payload + `"#"` (e.g. `>V#` → `*V206#`); `>S#` is the exception, replying three single-digit flags (`*S111#`) rather than one combined number.
- **Connection**: USB. The panel's controller is an ESP32-class board using Espressif's native USB-serial/JTAG stack (by-id name `usb-Espressif_USB_JTAG_serial_debug_unit_...`), not a CH340/CH341 adapter. Auto-detection scans `/dev/serial/by-id/` for CH340/CH341/generic USB-serial names as well as `Espressif`, then probes with the `>H#` identity handshake. Falls back to `/dev/ttyUSB0`–`/dev/ttyUSB9`.
- **Cover**: no motorized cover on this model — `OpenCover`/`CloseCover`/`HaltCover` throw `MethodNotImplemented` unconditionally and `CoverState` always reports `NotPresent`.
- **Tested model**: Gemini Astro Flat Panel Cover Lite (firmware 206) on Linux arm64.
- **ConformU**: 4.4.0 — 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues.

<summary><strong>Gemini Astro Automatic FlatPanel v2 Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Protocol**: no vendor docs or hardware were available for this model — implemented entirely from INDI's open-source `GeminiFlatpanelRev2Adapter` (`indilib/indi`, `drivers/auxiliary/gemini_flatpanel_adapters.{h,cpp}`). Shares the `">X#"`/`">Xnnn#"` wire syntax and light/brightness commands (`>L#`/`>D#`/`>B<value>#`/`>J#`) with the Lite model above; adds a real motorized cover (`>O#`/`>C#`) and a different `>S#` status reply layout (`*S<2-digit id><motor><light><cover>#`).
- **Connection**: USB, 9600 baud 8N1. Selected via a `flatPanelModel` config field (`"lite"`/`"v2"`) on the same `gemini`+`covercalibrator` router slot as the Lite model; shares port auto-detection with the Lite driver.
- **Cover**: `OpenCover`/`CloseCover` block the wire for up to 30s until the hardware's exact completion reply (`*OOpened#`/`*CClosed#`) arrives, run on a background thread so the ASCOM async initiator returns immediately. `HaltCover` has no hardware equivalent on Rev2 — it stops the driver from *reporting* `Moving` but cannot interrupt the in-flight motor command.
- **Calibrator/cover port contention**: `CalibratorOn`/`CalibratorOff` share the same physical serial link and port-level mutex as `OpenCover`/`CloseCover`. Calling `CalibratorOn` while a cover move is in flight can block behind the cover's up-to-30s wire wait; **fixed by running `CalibratorOn`/`CalibratorOff` on a background thread** (mirroring the cover task) so the ASCOM initiator still returns immediately, with `CalibratorChanging`/`CalibratorState` correctly reporting `NotReady` while the background command is in flight. Caught by ConformU: the first `CalibratorOn` call, issued right after a `HaltCover` on a cover that was still physically moving, blocked the HTTP thread for 6+ seconds before this fix.
- **Tested model**: Gemini Astro Automatic FlatPanel v2 (firmware 408) on Linux arm64.
- **ConformU**: 4.5.0 — 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues.

<summary><strong>Gemini Motorized Flat Panel V3 Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Protocol**: the firmware INDI calls "Pro" (`GeminiFlatpanelProAdapter` in `indilib/indi`), confirmed against real hardware. Same `">X#"`/`">Xnnn#"` wire syntax and light commands as the other Gemini panels; identifies as `*HGeminiFlatPanelPro#`, reports status as `*S<motor>M<light>L<cover>C...#` (flags at fixed positions, extra fields ignored) and acknowledges `>O#`/`>C#` with the reached position (`*O405#`/`*C70#`) once travel completes (~10 s).
- **Connection**: USB (CH340 adapter), 9600 baud 8N1. Selected via `flatPanelModel: "pro"` on the same `gemini`+`covercalibrator` router slot as the Lite and v2 models; shares port auto-detection with them.
- **Cover**: `OpenCover`/`CloseCover` run on a background thread and report `Moving` until the hardware acknowledges; `HaltCover` has no hardware equivalent (as on v2) and stops the driver from reporting `Moving`. Extra manual-jog and set-position commands exist in the firmware but are outside the ASCOM CoverCalibrator interface and are not exposed.
- **Calibrator**: the firmware takes ~125 ms per light command, so a toggle (`>L#`/`>D#` plus `>B<n>#`) completes in ~250 ms; `CalibratorOn`/`CalibratorOff` return with the state already applied unless a cover move is holding the serial link.
- **Tested model**: Gemini Motorized Flat Panel V3 (firmware 107) on Linux arm64 (Raspberry Pi).
- **ConformU**: 4.5.0 — 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues. Start ConformU with the cover closed: ConformU 4.5's test order for a cover that starts open runs `HaltCover` before it has classified the cover as asynchronous and reports a spurious issue.

<details>
<summary><strong>iOptron Filter Wheel Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Protocol**: iEFW serial protocol (`:DeviceInfo#`, `:FW1#`, `:WP#`, `:WMnn#`), no SDK required. Reference: INDI `drivers/filter_wheel/ioptron_wheel.cpp`.
- **Connection**: USB/Serial via the built-in Prolific PL2303 bridge (067b:23a3), fixed 115200 baud. Auto-detection supported.
- **Tested models**: iEFW-15 (model code 99, 5 slots) and iEFW-18 (model code 98, 8 slots), firmware 100 / `:FW1#` 241010241010, on Raspberry Pi, Linux arm64, ConformU 4.5.0: 0 errors, 0 issues, all members within timing targets for both
- **Auto-detection**: Scans `/dev/serial/by-id/` and `/dev/ttyUSB*` for Prolific adapters and probes with the `:DeviceInfo#` handshake; only model codes 99 (iEFW-15) and 98 (iEFW-18) are accepted, so an iOptron mount or iEAF/iAFS focuser on the same chip class is skipped.
- **Model / slot count**: the web UI Model selector (iEFW-15 / iEFW-18) sets the reported device name and pre-selects the slot picker; the slot count actually used is read from the wheel's model code at connect (a mismatch is logged as a warning).
- **Filter names / focus offsets**: stored in the AlpacaBridge config (ZWO EFW conventions). Offsets stored on the wheel (`:WF`, set via iOptron's own software) seed `FocusOffsets` at connect when the config supplies none; config overrides and nothing is written back (Player One convention).
- **Position**: reports `-1` while the wheel is moving, per the ASCOM IFilterWheel contract.
- **Known hardware limitation**: the wheel's IR slot sensor stays lit whenever the wheel has power, independent of commands or polling, so the driver cannot switch it off (no such command exists; iOptron says a board revision is needed). If dark frames show a leak, shield the sensor window from the aperture side with black flocking or opaque tape.
- **iEFW-18 is 8 usable slots, not the 9 advertised**: it is two stacked 5-slot wheels, each with one unthreaded open slot so the other wheel's filter can be selected, giving 8 filter positions. The firmware reports 8 (model code 98) and the driver follows the firmware. A filter change may rotate both wheels, so some moves take noticeably longer than others.

<details>
<summary><strong>QHY FilterWheel Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **SDK**: QHY CCD SDK 26.06.04.16 (shared with the QHY camera driver)
- **Connection**: USB — controlled through the SAME physical handle as its paired QHY camera (not a separately enumerable device); the camera and filter wheel driver share one `OpenQHYCCD` via a reference-counted handle in `QHYSDKWrapper`, and can be connected/disconnected independently.
- **Tested model**: miniCam8M integrated CFW (8-slot) on Linux arm64
- **ConformU**: 4.4.0 — 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues
- **Standalone QHYCFW3 over USB** (`wheelType: cfw3-usb`, no SDK): the wheel's own USB socket is a Silicon Labs CP2102 serial bridge at 9600 baud speaking QHY's bare-ASCII protocol (goto `0`..`F`, `VRS`, `MXP`, `NOW`). Set the wheel's internal mode switch to USB mode (red LED flash at power-on); in 4-pin mode it ignores USB commands. Opening the port resets the wheel, which then homes for about 17 seconds before it will talk, so the first connect after AlpacaBridge starts takes about 18 seconds and exceeds the 5 second Platform 7 `Connect` budget ConformU applies; the port is then held open and later connects are immediate. The ConformU run below was made with the wheel connected once beforehand in the web UI, which is the recommended way to start any client session. Slot count and firmware date are read from the wheel at connect. Auto-detect probes every CP210x adapter on the machine and resets each one; prefer an explicit serial port when other CP210x devices are attached. Tested model: 7-slot CFW3, firmware 20181114, ConformU 4.5.1 on Linux arm64 (IFilterWheelV3): 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues. Protocol notes: `AlpacaCore/external/QHY/QHYCFW3-USB-protocol.md`.
- **Position caching**: `GetQHYCCDCFWStatus` is a ~100-130ms hardware round trip on this SDK, which blows the ASCOM FAST (0.1s) target for the first `Position`/`DeviceState` read after `Connect`. The driver does one warm-up read during `Connect` (charged against the 1.0s STANDARD budget) and caches the settled position afterward. The cache is served only when no move is outstanding — while a move is pending, every read stays live and is compared against the commanded target before caching, because this SDK does **not** report a distinct "moving" sentinel the way ToupTek's does: `GetQHYCCDCFWStatus` reports the wheel's actual passing position throughout the physical rotation (including intermediate slots and occasional `-1`) until it settles. A live read taken mid-move that doesn't match the commanded target is masked to `-1` rather than passed through raw — otherwise a client polling during the move can read a real but unrelated transit slot and mistake it for an erroneous arrival — and caching the first post-move reading unconditionally would still freeze `Position` at a stale value and the wheel would never appear to arrive.

- **Connection**: USB (enumerated by the toupcam SDK via `TOUPCAM_FLAG_FILTERWHEEL`; standalone AFW-M, not a camera-integrated wheel)
- **Tested model**: AFW-M 7-slot on Linux arm64 (wheel firmware `FILTERWHEEL01A_V202_20250903.iic`)
- **ConformU**: 4.3.0 — 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues
- **Homing at connect**: the driver reads the slot count, writes it back, and homes the wheel (`FILTERWHEEL_POSITION = -1`) at connect — mirroring the INDI toupbase reference driver — so the firmware establishes its slot reference. This is unconditional (matches INDI) and does not depend on a particular firmware; it matters most right after a firmware flash, which clears the slot reference and otherwise leaves the wheel hunting without landing. Expect the wheel to home once on connect.
- **Position** reports −1 while the wheel is rotating, per the ASCOM IFilterWheelV3 contract.

- **Minimum firmware**: 20260124 (older firmware predates the status-stream protocol; update via WandererEmpire)

<details>
<summary><strong>iOptron Focuser Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Protocol**: iEAF serial protocol (`:DeviceInfo#`, `:FI#`, `:FM`, `:FQ`, `:FZ`), no SDK required. The iAFS2/3 speaks the identical protocol and is served by the same driver; the web UI Model selector (iEAF / iAFS2/3) sets the reported device name. The `:DeviceInfo#` handshake accepts both model codes (2 = iEAF, 3 = iAFS2/3).
- **Connection**: USB/Serial via the built-in Prolific PL2303 bridge (iEAF 067b:23d3, iAFS2/3 067b:23a3 "ATEN Serial Bridge"), fixed 115200 baud. Auto-detection supported.
- **Auto-detection**: Scans `/dev/serial/by-id/` and `/dev/ttyUSB*` for Prolific adapters and probes with the `:DeviceInfo#` handshake (model code 2/3), which also distinguishes the iEAF from an iOptron mount on the same chip class.
- **Tested models**: iEAF (model code 2, firmware 100) and iAFS2 (model code 3) on Raspberry Pi, Linux arm64, ConformU 4.5.0: 0 errors, 0 issues, all members within timing targets for both
- **Not supported**: `StepSize` (hardware does not expose microns), temperature compensation
- **Protocol quirks**: `:FM`/`:FQ`/`:FZ` reply with a single `1` ack byte (no `#`), which the wrapper consumes so it cannot prefix the next `:FI#` frame. Status reads are served from a 100 ms cache so `DeviceState` costs one serial round trip.

- **Protocol**: Q-Focuser JSON serial protocol (`{"cmd_id":N,...}` / `{"idx":N,...}`), no SDK required. The QHY camera SDK is not involved; the driver only shares the `qhy` vendor group.
- **Connection**: USB CDC-ACM via the focuser's GigaDevice GD32 MCU (`28e9:018a`, `/dev/ttyACMn`), fixed 9600 baud. Auto-detection supported.
- **Auto-detection**: Scans `/dev/serial/by-id/` for the GigaDevice interface and falls back to `/dev/ttyACM0`-`/dev/ttyACM9` filtered by USB descriptor, probing with the version handshake.
- **Configuration**: `maxStep` (default 64000), `reverse`, `speed` (1 fastest to 8 slowest), `temperatureSource` (external probe or controller board), and the 12 V hold settings `holdForce`, `holdIhold` (0-16), `holdIrun` (0-30). `reverse` and `speed` are sent to the firmware at connect, and the hold settings too but only when the focuser reports a supply above 11.5 V. `maxStep` and `temperatureSource` are driver-side: `maxStep` bounds the ASCOM `Move` range (the firmware is not told a limit), and `temperatureSource` selects which sensor `Temperature` reports.
- **Tested model**: Q-Focuser High Precision (firmware 20231207, board 208) on Linux arm64, ConformU 4.5.1: 0 errors, 0 issues, all members within timing targets
- **Link loss**: if the USB cable is pulled mid-session, the next read fails with `NotConnected`, `Connected` reads false, and the port is released so a replugged focuser re-enumerates under the same name. Set `Connected` true again to reconnect.
- **Not supported**: `StepSize` (hardware does not expose microns), temperature compensation
- **Protocol quirks**: no moving flag, so `IsMoving` is derived from position versus target with a 1.5 s stall grace; position and telemetry are served from short caches (100 ms / 1 s) so `DeviceState` costs at most two serial round trips (one for position/is-moving, one more for temperature when the 1 s cache is cold).

<summary><strong>Gemini Switch Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Power & Data Hubs Advanced 3** (`vendor: gemini`, `deviceType: switch`, `switchType: pdh-adv3`) — the power and USB hub as 24 Alpaca switches: USB A–F power (A/B are the USB 3.2 Gen1 ports), DC1 always-on (read-only), DC2–DC5 switched 12 V outputs, DEW6/DEW7 dew heater outputs (0–100 % PWM in Manual mode, on/off in Auto or Switch mode, the same behaviour as the vendor's Windows driver), DEW6/DEW7 mode selectors (0 Auto PID, 1 Manual, 2 Switch; runtime-only, never persisted), and read-only telemetry: input voltage, output current and power, AHT20 ambient temperature, humidity and dew point, DS18B20 lens temperature, and the two sensor-attached flags. Auto mode needs both the AHT20 (Temp port) and the DS18B20 (Dew Temp port) plugged in; the firmware runs a PID loop that keeps the lens above the dew point. Custom switch names are runtime-only.
  - **Protocol**: vendor `>X#` ASCII serial protocol at 19200 8N1 over the hub's CH340 bridge (no SDK). Reverse-engineered from the vendor's own ASCOM driver (v2.6.0206); summary in `AlpacaCore/external/Gemini/PowerDataHubAdv3-protocol.md`. Firmware 3.0.8 or newer is required (older firmware is refused at connect, as the vendor driver does).
  - **Tested model**: Power & Data Hubs Advanced 3 (firmware 3.0.9) on Linux arm64 (Raspberry Pi, Debian 13).
  - **ConformU** 4.5.0 — ✓ 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues on the Raspberry Pi (DeviceState with all 73 properties in 43 ms against the 100 ms FAST target; every other member under 20 ms). A second clean run on an arm64 Debian 13 VM preceded it. [Report](AlpacaCore/conformu/Gemini/Power%20%26%20Data%20Hubs%20Advanced%203/Linux-arm64.txt).

<details>
<summary><strong>iOptron Switch Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **iMate PowerBox** (`vendor: ioptron`, `deviceType: switch`) — the iMate's on-board DC power ports via libgpiod v2 on `/dev/gpiochip1` (override with `gpioChip`). Exposes three switches: `DC3 (always on)` — the hardwired pass-through jack, read-only; `DC1` — GPIO line 118 (PD22); `DC2` — GPIO line 114 (PD18). Ports default to boolean on/off; DC1/DC2 can each opt into 0–100% soft-PWM dimming (per-port `pwm` flag, `pwmFrequencyHz` default 50 Hz) for dew heaters and flat panels — 50 Hz dims panels, confirmed on iMate hardware. Local GPIO only — independent of the iOptron mount RS-232 protocol; runs on the iMate itself under the [OpenAstro](https://github.com/open-astro/aw-flashtool) Armbian image (mainline kernel, Debian 13), which already ships libgpiod v2 plus a `gpio`-group udev rule for `/dev/gpiochip*`. Connecting powers the ports on; disconnecting does not power them off. Setup: [PowerPorts.md](AlpacaCore/PowerPorts.md#ioptron-imate).
  - **ConformU** 4.4.0 — ✓ validated on iMate hardware (Linux arm64; OpenAstro Armbian / mainline kernel, `/dev/gpiochip1`): 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues. Run against a mixed config (DC1 PWM with the full 0–100% sweep, DC2 boolean, DC3 read-only pass-through) so all three port types were exercised in one pass. Re-validated on the shared `SwitchDriver` base `DeviceState` (issue #107): all per-id properties + TimeStamp present and GET-consistent; slowest member 12 ms.

<details>
<summary><strong>Player One Switch Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Thermal Switch** (`vendor: playerone`, `deviceType: switch`) — exposes a cooled Player One camera's dew (lens) heater and radiator fan (`POA_HEATER_POWER` / `POA_FAN_POWER`) as 0–100% multi-value switch elements, giving clients like NINA sliders for runtime control. Binds to the camera by `cameraIndex` and shares the camera's SDK handle via reference-counted open/close, so it can connect alongside the camera device or on its own. The element list is probed per model at connect; connecting against an uncooled camera (no heater, no fan) fails with `NotImplemented`. Heater/fan are deliberately runtime-only — nothing persists across connects, so a heater turned on in December cannot silently re-apply months later. Cooling itself stays on the standard Camera interface (`CoolerOn` / `SetCCDTemperature`); the cooler is intentionally not a switch element.
  - **ConformU** 4.4.0 — ✓ validated on Uranus-C PRO hardware (Linux arm64, Raspberry Pi CM4): 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues. Full 0–100% heater sweep and the fan's `Minimum: 1` floor (fan cannot run at 0%; `SetSwitchValue(0)` correctly rejected). Re-validated on the shared `SwitchDriver` base `DeviceState` (issue #107): all per-id properties + TimeStamp present and GET-consistent in 10 ms. Heater previously verified by calorimetry (4.3.0 run): at a held −10 °C target, heater 0→100% raised steady-state cooler power ~34%→~44%, symmetric on heater-off.

<details>
<summary><strong>ToupTek Switch Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Thermal Switch** (`vendor: touptek`, `deviceType: switch`, `switchType: thermal`) — exposes a cooled ToupTek camera's anti-fog dew heater (`TOUPCAM_OPTION_HEAT`), radiator fan (`TOUPCAM_OPTION_FAN`), and tail indicator LED (`TOUPCAM_OPTION_TAILLIGHT`, on/off — turn off to avoid light leaks during imaging) as switch elements. Element ranges come from the camera (fan speed `[0, maxfanspeed]` — often a single on/off speed; heater `[0, HEAT_MAX]`); elements are capability-probed per model at connect (heater/fan via `FLAG_HEAT`/`FLAG_FAN`, the tail LED by probing the option). Binds by `cameraIndex` and shares the camera's Toupcam handle via a reference-counted open, so it runs alongside the camera device. The cooler itself stays on the Camera interface (`CoolerOn` / `SetCCDTemperature`), not a switch element.
  - **ConformU** 4.4.0 — ✓ validated on ATR2600M hardware (Linux arm64): 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues. Three elements exercised: `DewHeater` (0–4), `Fan` (0–1, single-speed on this model), `TailLight` (0–1). Re-validated on the shared `SwitchDriver` base `DeviceState` (issue #107): all per-id properties + TimeStamp present and GET-consistent; slowest member 2 ms. [Report](AlpacaCore/conformu/ToupTek/ATR2600M%20Thermal%20Switch/Linux-arm64.txt).
- **StellaVita PowerBox** (`vendor: touptek`, `deviceType: switch`, `switchType: stellavita`) — the StellaVita's four on-board 12V DC ports via libgpiod v2 on `/dev/gpiochip0` (override with `gpioChip`). Exposes Port 1–4 mapped to BCM GPIO 18/10/17/4 (on BCM2711 the libgpiod line offset equals the BCM GPIO number); mapping verified on hardware against the board's `gpio=18,10,17,4,9,11=op,dh,pu` config.txt directive. GPIO 9/11 power the on-board Cypress USB hub and are deliberately not exposed. All four ports are boolean on/off by default; each can opt into 0–100% soft-PWM dimming (per-port `pwm` flag, `pwmFrequencyHz` default **100 Hz** — tested best on StellaVita, dims flat panels smoothly without 50 Hz flicker). Local GPIO only — independent of the ToupTek camera/focuser SDK; runs on the StellaVita itself (arm64). Connecting preserves the board's boot-high state (ports powered on); disconnecting does not power them off. Setup: [PowerPorts.md](AlpacaCore/PowerPorts.md#touptek-stellavita-raspberry-pi-cm4).
  - **ConformU** 4.4.0 — ✓ validated on StellaVita hardware (Linux arm64; Raspberry Pi CM4, Debian 13 Trixie, `/dev/gpiochip0`): 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues. Run against a mixed config (Port 1 PWM with the full 0–100% sweep, Ports 2–4 boolean) so both the boolean and soft-PWM paths were exercised in one pass; DeviceState reported all 4 ids + TimeStamp via the shared `SwitchDriver` base in 9 ms.

- **WandererBox Pro V3** (`vendor: wandererastro`, `deviceType: switch`, `switchType: wandererbox-pro-v3`) — the 11-port power box as 24 Alpaca switches: DC1/DC2 always-on rails (read-only), DC3-4 adjustable output (on/off + 5.0–13.2 V setpoint, 0.1 V steps), DC5/6/7 PWM dew heaters (0–255), DC8-9/DC10-11 switched pairs, five USB power groups, and ten read-only sensor switches (input voltage, three currents, ambient temp/humidity, dew point, three temperature probes; unconnected sensors report -127 °C / 0). Dew-heater auto modes (dew-point/constant-temperature) stay device-side — set them in WandererEmpire; the driver writes manual PWM only, matching the vendor's own ASCOM driver.
  - **Protocol**: WandererBox streamed-status serial protocol at 19200 8N1 (no SDK). Reference: INDI `wandererbox_pro_v3`.
  - **Tested model**: WandererBox Pro V3 (firmware 20250410) on Linux arm64 (Debian 13).

<summary><strong>ZWO Switch Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Dew Heater** (`switchType: dewheater`) — exposed when the camera reports the SDK control `ASI_ANTI_DEW_HEATER`. Bind to a camera via `cameraIndex` / `cameraId`.
  - **ConformU** 4.4.0 — 0 errors / 0 issues / 0 timing, Linux arm64 (Debian 13 Trixie), ASI2600MM Pro. Re-validated on the shared `SwitchDriver` base `DeviceState` (issue #107): all per-id properties + TimeStamp present and GET-consistent; slowest member 10 ms.
- **ASIAIR Pro 12V Power** (`switchType: asiair`) — four on-board 12V DC ports via libgpiod v2. Default Pi 4 layout: Port 1 = GPIO 12, Port 2 = GPIO 13, Port 3 = GPIO 26, Port 4 = GPIO 18 on `/dev/gpiochip0`. Ports are boolean by default; set `"pwm": true` for a 0–100% soft-PWM channel (default 1 kHz, via `pwmFrequencyHz`). Runs on the ASIAIR itself; arm64-only (re-image the stock 32-bit OS) with the stock `pigpiod`/`zwoair_imager` disabled. Setup: [PowerPorts.md](AlpacaCore/PowerPorts.md).
  - **ConformU** 4.4.0 — 0 errors / 0 issues / 0 timing, Linux arm64 (Raspberry Pi 4, Debian 13 Trixie). Mixed 2 PWM (full 0–100% sweeps) + 2 boolean config. Re-validated on the shared `SwitchDriver` base `DeviceState` (issue #107): all 4 ids × per-id properties + TimeStamp, GET-consistent in 11 ms.
- **ASIAIR Plus 12V Power — Pi CM4** (`switchType: asiair-plus-picm4`) — the CM4 ASIAIR Plus (Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, BCM2711) shares the Pro's wiring exactly (GPIO 12/13/26/18 on `/dev/gpiochip0`, active-high, default-on), verified against live hardware (GPIO13 read back at 59%, GPIO26 at 34%). Reuses the `asiair` driver and `default_asiair_pro_config()` unchanged — `asiair-plus-picm4` is a thin router/UI alias, not a separate driver. Same arm64 / disable-stock-daemons constraints as the Pro. Setup: [PowerPorts.md](AlpacaCore/PowerPorts.md).
  - **ConformU** 4.4.0 — 0 errors / 0 issues / 0 timing, Linux arm64 (Raspberry Pi CM4, Debian 13 Trixie). Mixed 2 PWM (full 0–100% sweeps) + 2 boolean config. Re-validated on the shared `SwitchDriver` base `DeviceState` (issue #107): all 4 ids × per-id properties + TimeStamp, GET-consistent in 9 ms.
- **ASIAIR Plus 12V Power — RK3568** (`switchType: asiair-plus-rk3568`) — Rockchip RK3568 ASIAIR Plus via ZWO's `pwm_gpio.ko` kernel module on `/dev/pwm-gpio-misc` (reverse-engineered header at `AlpacaCore/external/ZWO/asiair-plus/pwm_gpio.h`). Wrapper indices 0–3 → kernel ioctl indices 4–7 (DC1–DC4). `SET_LEVEL` polarity is inverted (`level=0` ⇒ port ON); the wrapper hides this so ASCOM `value=1` = on. PWM is userspace soft-PWM (default **50 Hz**, matching the stock daemon's `period_ns = 20,000,000`); the module's own hardware-PWM path is unreachable and GPIO bank 4 has no PWM mux. Requires the stock ZWO kernel (4.19.219) to keep `pwm_gpio.ko` loaded, plus the `99-zwo-asiair-plus.rules` udev rule and `gpio`-group membership. Setup: [PowerPorts.md](AlpacaCore/PowerPorts.md).
  - **ConformU** 4.4.0 — 0 errors / 0 issues / 0 timing, Linux arm64 (kernel 4.19.219 + stock `pwm_gpio.ko`). Mixed 1 PWM (full 0–100% sweep through the ioctl soft-PWM) + 3 boolean config. Re-validated on the shared `SwitchDriver` base `DeviceState` (issue #107): all 4 ids × per-id properties + TimeStamp, GET-consistent in 14 ms. This run also proved the fixed `.deb` packaging end-to-end on a stock-kernel box (bundled `99-zwo-asiair-plus.rules` + postinst `gpio` group creation — previously the device was EACCES-dead unless the shell installers had run).

| CGX-L | USB/Serial (hand controller) | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/Celestron/) |

<details>
<summary><strong>Celestron Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Protocol**: NexStar HC serial protocol with MC passthrough (P-command) for per-axis control.
- **Connection**: USB/Serial via hand controller.
- **Required firmware**: Driver is built and tested against **HC (GEM) 5.35.3179** and **MC 7.18.5020**. Other firmware versions are not supported — behavior on earlier or later firmware has not been validated and may differ in slew, tracking, and pier-side semantics.
- **Required HC startup**: Power mount on, press Enter through Switch Position → Location → select **Last Alignment** → Enter. HC must show **"CGX-L Ready"** before connecting the driver. Slews are refused until the mount reports aligned or a `SyncToCoordinates` has been performed in the current driver session.
- **Location/time**: `SiteLatitude`, `SiteLongitude`, and `UTCDate` writes are silently skipped once the mount is aligned — applying them would invalidate the HC alignment model (especially StarSense). Writes succeed from the client's perspective but do not touch the mount. Set these before completing alignment if you need them to take effect.
- **RA slew offset**: Driver learns a running-average RA undershoot correction and pre-biases subsequent slews (adaptation matches INDI's `SlewOffsetRa`). CGX-L fw 7.18 does not track during a goto, causing consistent RA undershoot without this compensation.
- **Post-slew tracking**: Tracking is re-asserted via the top-level `T` set-tracking-mode command after each slew completes; CGX-L fw 7.18 does not auto-resume tracking after goto.
- **Pulse guiding**: Uses native MC_AUX_GUIDE (0x26) hardware command via the autoguider port. The firmware times the pulse internally — no software sleep or encoder math required. Position hold/correction pattern bridges the gap between the low-level firmware command and ASCOM coordinate expectations.
- **Pier side**: `SideOfPier` reports actual pier side via the HC `p` command (`W` = pierWest, `E` = pierEast).

<details>
<summary><strong>iOptron Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Protocol**: iOptron Mount RS-232 Command Language Version 3.10 (January 4th, 2021)
- **Connection**: USB/Serial or Wi-Fi (TCP). Auto-detection supported for both — `connectionType: "auto"` scans serial ports first, then falls back to network discovery if no serial mount is found.
- **Serial auto-detection**: Scans `/dev/serial/by-id/` for Prolific, FTDI, CP210x, Silicon Labs, and generic USB-serial devices and probes each with an iOptron `:MountInfo#` query at 115200 baud. Falls back to `/dev/ttyUSB0`–`/dev/ttyUSB9`. The 4-byte model code response (no `#` terminator) is mapped to a human-readable mount name (e.g., `0025` → HEM27) using the current INDI v3 model table.
- **Network auto-detection**: When the connection type is set to Network/Auto, the driver runs a multi-phase discovery: (1) probes well-known iOptron Wi-Fi module addresses (`10.10.100.254`, `10.10.100.1`, `192.168.100.1`) on ports 8899 and 4030; (2) if no mount found, queries the default gateway on each local interface (iOptron mounts act as the AP gateway); (3) if still not found, scans all hosts on each local subnet (up to /24) with parallel non-blocking TCP connect probes. Each candidate is verified with a `:MountInfo#` query before being accepted.
- **Mount identification**: On connect, the driver queries `:MountInfo#` and maps the model code to a name displayed in `Name` (e.g., "iOptron HEM27"), `UniqueID`, and server logs. 60+ models supported including CEM, GEM, HEM, HAE, HAZ, and SkyHunter series.
- **Wi-Fi reliability**: Network (TCP) connections drain stale acknowledgment bytes from blind commands to prevent buffer accumulation on the mount's Wi-Fi module. `IsPulseGuiding` uses lock-free atomics to meet the ConformU fast response target over high-latency links.
- **Tested firmware**: Driver tested on **HEM27** with main board firmware **V240121** and hand controller firmware **V241201**, on **HAE29C EQ** (model code 0036, current firmware as of 2026-07-14), and on **HAE16 EQ** (model code 0012, main/RA/Dec firmware 241201, the latest HAE package as of 2026-08-26). Other firmware versions and models may work but have not been individually verified.
- **HAE29C firmware quirks**: The driver carries three hardware-verified workarounds gated strictly to model code 0036 (other models are unaffected): (1) `:MP1#` park slews complete physically but never report status 6 — the driver sends `:ST0#` to finalize once the mount is stationary at the park target; (2) a park issued while already at the park position wedges the same way and gets the same finalizer; (3) GOTO stops compensating sidereal motion during its final ~1 s approach, settling ~11–16 arcsec east in RA — the driver closes the residual with a duration-computed pulse-guide trim (up to 3 iterations). The GOTO trim (3) is also enabled for the **HAE16 EQ** (model code 0012), which shows the identical settle signature on firmware 241201; its park is clean, so the park finalizers (1)-(2) stay HAE29C-only.
- **ConformU**: HEM27 validated with ConformU 4.3.0 (USB and Wi-Fi); HAE29C validated with ConformU 4.5.0 (USB, 2026-08-25; Park and MoveAxis stop verified against the 1 s asynchronous-initiator target) — 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing violations, on Linux arm64. HAE16 EQ validated with ConformU 4.5.1 (USB, 2026-08-27, including the extended SideOfPier/DestinationSideOfPier model tests) — 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing violations. Earlier 4.5.0 runs on the same build were also 0 errors / 0 issues but carried two ~0.1 s FAST marks on `EquatorialSystem`/`SideOfPier` that were ConformU-side (.NET first-use per response type, fixed in 4.5.1; see ASCOMInitiative/ConformU#31).

<details>
<summary><strong>OnStep Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Protocol**: LX200-derived serial protocol, per INDI's `lx200_OnStep` reference driver (no vendor SDK or protocol PDF — OnStep is open-source firmware for DIY/retrofit mounts, commonly run on Arduino Mega/Due, Teensy, or ESP32 boards).
- **Connection**: USB/Serial only in this project (no Wi-Fi/network config exposed). Default 9600 baud, 8N1. Auto-detection scans `/dev/serial/by-id/` (common USB-serial chip vendor IDs plus `Arduino`/`Teensy` substrings) falling back to `/dev/ttyUSB0`–`9` **and** `/dev/ttyACM0`–`9` (OnStep boards commonly enumerate as ttyACM), probing each with the `:GVP#` identity command.
- **Pulse guiding**: Native hardware pulse guide with mount-side timing (`:Mgn####`/`:Mgs####`/`:Mge####`/`:Mgw####`, milliseconds) — no software-timed stop thread required.
- **SideOfPier**: Always computed from hour angle (same convention as iOptron/SynScan/Celestron) — `:GU#`'s `E`/`W` flag reports the mount's *physical* pier orientation, not ASCOM's hour-angle-defined pointing state, and using it directly failed ConformU's SideofPier check on real hardware (see `.github/instructions/onstep.instructions.md`).
- **Tested model**: Generic OnStep DIY harmonic-drive mount, firmware "On-Step" v10.23a, Linux arm64.
- **ConformU**: 4.5.0 — 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing violations (clean run, 2026-08-08, re-validated on a freshly purged/reinstalled SBC after the auto-detect port-search refactor landed on `serial_by_id_scan.h`). PulseGuide ±9 East-West movement occasionally lands 1-2 residual issues right at the 0.07″ tolerance boundary on other runs — documented in `.github/instructions/onstep.instructions.md` as inherent hardware noise, root-caused via 4 independent tests, not a driver bug — accepted rather than chased with a tolerance/behavior change.

<details>
<summary><strong>Sky-Watcher Direct Motor Controller Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Protocol**: Sky-Watcher Motor Controller Command Set (see `AlpacaCore/external/SynScan/SkyWatcher_Motor_Controller_Command_Set.md`) — talks directly to the mount's motor board, no hand controller or SynScan app required. Distinct from the `synscan` hand-controller driver.
- **Connection**: USB (the mount's own USB port, an STM32 CDC-ACM virtual COM port at `/dev/ttyACM*`) or the mount's built-in Wi-Fi (UDP port 11880, AP address 192.168.4.1). `connectionType: "auto"` scans serial ports first (including `/dev/ttyACM0`–`9`), then runs Wi-Fi discovery (AP probe + UDP broadcast). Each candidate port is probed at 9600 and then 115200 (an EQ board's built-in USB port answers only at 115200), so a Prolific/FTDI/CH340-class port with nothing Sky-Watcher on it costs about 3.3 s per scan (up to roughly 4.4 s, since the read loops check their deadline only between reads); budget several seconds per such adapter before Wi-Fi discovery even starts.
- **Site required**: The motor controller stores no site or time. Set Site Latitude/Longitude in the device config (or via the Alpaca setters) — with the site unset the driver refuses to connect (`InvalidOperation`), so nothing can run on a guessed 0/0 site. Two things to know about that refusal: since #444 a value written through the setters is also learned into the device's `registered_devices.json` entry (`learnSiteFromClient`, on by default), so a device fixed that way stays fixed across a restart; with `learnSiteFromClient` off the setters satisfy it for the session only and the device config is the durable fix. And the client does not see `InvalidOperation`: the router reports a failed connect as `NotConnected`. Since #358 it carries the reason, so the `ErrorMessage` is the driver's own sentence naming the two fields rather than a bare "Connection failed"; the error number is unchanged.
- **Pointing math**: All in the driver — axis counts to RA/Dec via CPR read at connect, LST computed host-side, GEM-style pier-side branches, sidereal tracking via computed step periods. Sync uses the controller's native set-position command. Pulse guiding adjusts the RA step period in place while tracking (the axis never stops); Dec pulses are software-timed speed-mode nudges. Park and MoveAxis(0) are asynchronous initiators.
- **Tested model**: Wave 100i, motor board firmware 3.58 (mount code 0x44; the board reports `=033A44`, which is firmware major/minor plus the mount identity byte, not a three-part version), on Linux arm64 (USB).
- **Tested model (EQ class)**: EQM-35 Pro, motor board firmware 3.39 (mount code 0x32), over the mount's built-in USB port (soldered Prolific PL2303, 115200 baud), on Linux arm64 (Raspberry Pi 5, ConformU run on the Pi against localhost, chrony-disciplined clock). ConformU 4.5.1 (2026-09-30): 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing violations on the full suite including the physically measured pulse-guide, rate-offset, sync and slew checks. Site coordinates in the report are rounded to whole degrees. Goto landing and the post-slew tracking restart are verified against the controller (stopped AND stationary; restart rate-checked, except where the sample window cannot resolve the expected rate, which is logged) and the goto aim-ahead uses per-session measured goto overhead and restart latency, seeded from the Wave constants. The same mount also connects, and is found by auto-detect, over an EQDIR cable (FTDI FT232R) at 9600 baud rather than 115200 (2026-09-21, Raspberry Pi 3 Model B). With an explicit serial device, set `baudRate` to 9600 (the default); the built-in Prolific port needs 115200. No ConformU result is claimed for the EQDIR path.
- **AutoHome**: FindHome runs the SynScan-style AutoHome procedure using the mount's home index sensors, re-anchoring the position counters to the physical home mark regardless of the power-on position. Requires the home-index feature bit (Wave 100i reports it on both axes). On a board without that bit (EQM-35 Pro, feature word 0x7000) FindHome instead slews to the power-on count-frame home (counts 0x800000 on both axes) and reports AtHome only if both axes land there; it does not re-anchor to a physical mark.
- **Do not mix the hand controller and this driver on one power cycle**: when the tested SynScan V4 hand controller (firmware 04.28.00) started up, it rewrote the motor board's Dec position counter. On an EQM-35 Pro the Dec counter went from `0x800000` to `0xA32800` (+90 deg) with the mount untouched, while RA stayed at `0x800000`. This driver treats `0x800000` as home, so afterwards it reports the mount 90 deg out in Dec (Declination 0 with the mount at home), and `FindHome`, which slews to `0x800000`, would drive Dec 90 deg away from home. Unplug the hand controller and power-cycle the motor board with the mount at home before connecting this driver.
- **Tracking**: Sidereal, Lunar, and Solar drive rates, plus RA/Dec tracking rate offsets (comet/satellite tracking) at the Sidereal drive rate. Declination rates below the motor controller's ~0.26 arcsec/s slow-mode floor are produced by duty-cycling. The measured rate-offset tests are in the EQM-35 Pro report (ConformU 4.5.1); the linked Wave 100i reports predate the feature and are tracked for refresh in [#504](https://github.com/open-astro/AlpacaBridge/issues/504).
- **ConformU**: Wave 100i: 4.5.0 — 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing violations on BOTH transports (USB serial and Wi-Fi UDP; Raspberry Pi CM4, mount AP) on the same final build, including the physically measured pulse-guide, sync-return, and slew-accuracy checks. The RA/Dec tracking-rate offsets were validated afterwards on the Wave 100i over USB (ConformU 4.5.0, 2026-08-25): 0 errors, 0 issues, all 32 measured offset-rate checks within tolerance; that run's only marks were two 0.10x s FAST readings on constant `Can*` getters caused by the dev-VM network path (ConformU now runs on the SBC over localhost, see `/conformu`), so the linked logs remain the earlier full-suite reports. When connecting over the mount's Wi-Fi AP from a single-radio SBC, disable any hotspot sharing that radio (dual-role AP+client causes link flapping and UDP loss).

### SynScan V3/V4

| Model Series | Connection | Linux<br>(arm64) | Status |
|--------------|------------|------------------|--------|
| Sky-Watcher HEQ5 PRO | USB/Serial (hand controller) | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/SynScan/Sky-Watcher%20HEQ5%20PRO/) |

<details>
<summary><strong>SynScan Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Protocol**: Sky-Watcher SynScan V3/V4 protocol
- **Connection**: USB/Serial via hand controller (tested). Auto-detection supported — `connectionType: "auto"` scans serial ports for SynScan hand controllers and connects to the first responding mount.
- **Auto-detection**: Scans `/dev/serial/by-id/` for Prolific, FTDI, CP210x, and generic USB-serial devices and probes each with a SynScan firmware version query. Falls back to `/dev/ttyUSB0`–`/dev/ttyUSB9`.
- **Hand controller setup**: the driver reads pointing and `SideOfPier` from the hand controller's own model, so set the handset's date, time, time zone and site correctly, and power the mount on at its home position (counterweight bar down, pointing at the pole). On an EQM-35 Pro at latitude -37 with a wrong handset date, time and site and a board powered on away from home, `SideOfPier` read `pierWest` on both sides of the meridian. With the handset set up correctly, the same driver passed ConformU's SideOfPier checks (issue #243).
- **Sky-Watcher HEQ5 PRO Firmware**: Hand controller firmware 4.42.00, motor controller firmware 3.46
- **Pulse guiding**: Software-timed variable-rate slew (SynScan has no hardware pulse guide command). Driver issues a variable-rate axis slew at the configured guide rate, times the pulse duration in a background thread, then stops the axis and restores sidereal tracking. GEM pier-side DEC direction flip applied automatically. Position reporting uses accumulated `rate × duration` deltas in the target coordinate frame for ConformU tolerance compliance.
- **ConformU**: Validated with ConformU 4.3.0 — 0 errors, 0 issues (pulse guide tested across N/S/E/W at declinations -9, +9, -3, +3).

### ZWO

| Model Series | Connection | Linux<br>(arm64) | Status |
|--------------|------------|------------------|--------|
| AM3 | USB/Serial, Wi-Fi | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/ZWO/AM3/) |
| AM5 | USB/Serial, Wi-Fi |  | pending arm64 re-validation |
| AM5N | USB/Serial, Wi-Fi | ✓ | [ConformU Validation](AlpacaCore/conformu/ZWO/AM5N/) |

<details>
<summary><strong>ZWO Telescope (ASI Mount) Driver Notes</strong></summary>

- **Protocol**: ZWO Mount Serial Communication Protocol (see `AlpacaCore/external/ZWO/AM/ZWO_Mount_Protocol.md`)
- **Connection**: Serial over USB, network (TCP), or **auto-detect**. **Tested and working with USB and WiFi**. PulseGuide and slew behavior validated over both USB and WiFi; timing tuned for high-latency (WiFi) connections. `connectionType: auto` probes USB serial ports and the mount's WiFi AP (`192.168.4.1:4030`) at connect time and connects to whichever ZWO mount answers (AM3/AM5/AM5N/AM7).
- **Tested firmware**: Driver tested on ZWO **firmware 1.8.8\***. Other firmware versions and models (e.g., AM3, AM5, AM7) may work but have not been verified.
- **AM5N validated** (ConformU 4.4.0, Linux arm64, USB): 0 errors, 0 issues, 0 timing issues. Park requires the mount to have been homed; the driver infers park completion from a stationary mount when :hP does not physically move it. Setting Tracking=true while parked throws `InvalidWhileParked`. The park-state cache in the poll thread is left un-pinned during active parks so the completion inference is not defeated.
- **WiFi characteristics**: the same driver connects and operates over the mount's WiFi AP (`192.168.4.1:4030`) with auto-detect. ConformU over WiFi reports 0 errors but a few STANDARD (1.0 s) members (Park, FindHome, guide-rate writes) land at ~1.03–1.09 s because each operation costs several serial round-trips at WiFi latency — a link-speed characteristic, not a driver defect. USB is the ConformU-validated transport; WiFi is verified functional for normal use.
