# Development Guide

AlpacaBridge is developed **Claude-first**: the project ships with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skills that automate the entire driver lifecycle — from scaffolding a new vendor driver through ConformU hardware validation to opening the pull request — and an [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) knowledge base that captures every architecture rule and hardware lesson learned. Start there; the manual build, test, and packaging reference follows for the full picture of how everything works.

For end-user install instructions, see the [README](../README.md).

## Supported platforms

- **Debian 13 (Trixie)** on `arm64` (Raspberry Pi 3B+/4/5, Rockchip SBCs, OrangePi, iOptron iMate) — the only supported architecture
- Linux arm64 only — no amd64/x86_64, no 32-bit, no Windows or macOS

### Development machines

You don't need an SBC to develop — any arm64 machine running a **Debian 13 arm64 VM** makes a fast dev box:

- **Apple Silicon Mac** (M1 or newer) — run Debian 13 arm64 in [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/), Parallels, or VMware Fusion
- **Windows on ARM laptop** (Snapdragon X, etc.) — run Debian 13 arm64 in Hyper-V or VMware Workstation

Inside the VM the full toolchain, test suite, and CI pre-flight run natively at full speed. USB devices can be passed through to the VM for hardware work, but final ConformU validation should still run on a real supported SBC (see the [`/conformu` skill](#conformu--hardware-validation)).

## Developing with Claude Code

Open Claude Code in the repository root and the skills below are available as slash commands (defined in `.claude/commands/`). Together they cover the whole workflow:

```
/driver-build  →  /deploy-test  →  /conformu  →  /commit  →  /submit-pr
   implement       deploy to SBC     validate      commit       PR + review
```

### `/driver-build` — guided driver implementation

Walks through building, extending, or fixing device drivers:

- Verifies the vendored ASCOM Alpaca API spec is current against ascom-standards.org before any code is written
- Interactive Q&A: device type, vendor, connection method, SDK availability
- Searches INDI/INDIGO for reference drivers with fuzzy vendor name matching
- Creates the feature branch (`driver/<vendor>-<device>`)
- Guides through the 3-layer architecture, SDK cleanup, auto-detection, CMake setup, and AlpacaHTTP/web UI integration
- Enforces Catch2 tests (8 cases, 30+ assertions) and ASCOM Alpaca API compliance
- Validates with ConformU on arm64 and updates AGENTS.md with lessons learned

### `/deploy-test` — push the build to a test SBC

Gets the current working tree running on the test device so ConformU validates the right build:

- Builds the .deb from the working tree (`scripts/build_deb.sh`), reporting exactly what is deployed (branch, commit, dirty-tree state)
- Copies it to the SBC over SSH, installs it, and restarts `alpacabridge.service`
- Verifies the device is reachable and reports the deployed version via the management API before handing off to `/conformu`

### `/deploy-remote-test` — same, for an SBC with no SSH path

For a test SBC reachable only through a Raspberry Pi Connect browser shell (no LAN/SSH):

- Builds the .deb and publishes it as a temporary GitHub pre-release (`test-<suffix>-<hash>` tag) on the project repo
- Prints the paste-ready `curl` / `dpkg -i` / restart / md5 verification commands for the remote shell
- Deletes the pre-release and its tag once testing is done; ConformU then runs on the SBC against `127.0.0.1:6800`

### `/conformu` — hardware validation

Runs ConformU against a connected AlpacaBridge device and processes the results:

- Checks the installed ConformU against the [latest upstream release](https://github.com/ASCOMInitiative/ConformU/tags) and offers to update before running. On arm64 an installed 4.5.0 is always treated as outdated (the [ConformU 4.5.0 arm64 timing bug](../SUPPORTED-DRIVERS.md)), and until 4.5.1 ships as a GitHub release the replacement comes from the upstream beta URL rather than the release asset
- Validates the full pass criteria: 0 errors, 0 issues, **and** 0 timing issues (the Timing Summary is a separate pass criterion)
- Saves the logs under `AlpacaCore/conformu/<vendor>/<model>/`
- Updates [SUPPORTED-DRIVERS.md](../SUPPORTED-DRIVERS.md) with the validated entry

### `/commit` — stage, review, and commit

- Assesses the working tree, reviews diffs, flags red flags (SDK bloat, secrets, build artifacts)
- Hard-blocks committing failing ConformU reports
- Updates SUPPORTED-DRIVERS.md and `docs/architecture.md` if driver or ConformU changes are present
- Adds the PR's changelog fragment (`changelog.d/<branch-slug>.md`, never `CHANGELOG.md`); the release derives the SemVer bump from it (new driver = minor, fix/docs = patch, breaking = major)
- Writes verb-first commit messages with vendor/device specificity

### `/submit-pr` — pull request submission

- Safety checks: refuses to PR from `main`, blocks on uncommitted changes and failing ConformU reports
- Auto-detects direct contributor vs fork and handles both flows
- Runs the pre-submission checklist (tests, ConformU, changelog fragment, SUPPORTED-DRIVERS, AGENTS.md, license headers, SDK cleanup)
- Reproduces CI locally via `scripts/ci_preflight.sh` before pushing, so PRs never open red
- Builds the PR title and body with component-tagged changes and a test plan, then creates the PR via `gh`
- Watches for the automated review verdict and batches fixes into single pushes (every push restarts a full fresh review)

### AGENTS.md — the knowledge base

[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) is the project's living memory: architecture rules, the three-layer driver pattern, ConformU failure patterns, and per-vendor quirks discovered on real hardware. Every driver session ends by updating it — if something surprising was learned, it gets documented so the next session (human or agent) doesn't rediscover it. Read it before touching any driver code.

## Prerequisites

```sh
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake g++ \
    libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev libgpiod-dev \
    libhidapi-dev \
    libgphoto2-dev libraw-dev \
    nlohmann-json3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \
    zlib1g-dev libsystemd-dev pkgconf \
    catch2
```

This matches the `Build-Depends` field of `debian/control`, the authoritative list, plus `git` and `catch2` for the tests.

Verify: `cmake --version` (3.20+), `g++ --version` (GCC 10+, C++20 required).

> `libgpiod-dev` (>= 2.0) is required only for the GPIO-backed power-port Switch drivers (ZWO ASIAIR, iOptron iMate, ToupTek StellaVita). Without it those switches are cleanly disabled at configure time and the rest of the build is unaffected. See [PowerPorts.md](../AlpacaCore/PowerPorts.md).
> `libhidapi-dev` is required for the Astroasis USB HID focuser driver when building with all vendors enabled.

## Running tests

```sh
./run_all_tests.sh
```

The build runs at `nproc`, but `ctest` runs at twice that: most of the suite
waits on fake hardware in real time rather than computing, so tying it to the
core count leaves the machine idle. Override with `CTEST_PARALLEL` on a machine
where that is too aggressive:

```sh
CTEST_PARALLEL=4 ./run_all_tests.sh
```

Or manually:

```sh
cd build && ctest
```

Filter by tag: `./build/tests/alpacacore_tests [zwo][camera]`
Exclude hardware tests: `./build/tests/alpacacore_tests ~[hardware]`

Both assume the `build` directory `run_all_tests.sh` just made. A pre-flight leaves a different
one there (see below), so after one, rebuild rather than filtering against what is left.

Before pushing, reproduce the full CI gate set locally:

```sh
./scripts/ci_preflight.sh
```

This runs clang-format, the Unicode/Trojan-Source scan, both build+test configurations (vendors OFF and ON), clang-tidy, cppcheck, and — when the relevant files changed — shellcheck, the web UI JavaScript gate (`node --check` for syntax plus `node --test` for the pure formatters in `AlpacaHTTP/web/format.js`, triggered by changes under `AlpacaHTTP/web/` or `AlpacaHTTP/tests/web/`), and zizmor. It finishes with the ASan+UBSan pass, which is on by default since #588 and runs last of the default gates, after zizmor; `RUN_SANITIZERS=0` opts out, and the opt-in `RUN_TSAN=1` and `RUN_SCAN_BUILD=1` passes run after it when set. `/submit-pr` runs it automatically.

## Writing tests

Every driver requires at minimum **8 test cases** and **30+ assertions** using Catch2. Tests live in `AlpacaCore/tests/`.

### Required test cases

1. **Device information** — device type, name, unique ID, description, driver version, interface version
2. **Connection states** — initial disconnected, connect/disconnect cycle
3. **Not-connected errors** — every operation while disconnected must throw `AlpacaException` with `AlpacaError::NotConnected` error code
4. **Capability reporting** — all capability properties return valid values without throwing
5. **Device-specific operations** — exposure for cameras, slewing for telescopes, etc.

### ASCOM contract tests (ConformU alignment)

These tests catch the bugs that fail ConformU. They run without hardware and verify that the driver follows the ASCOM Alpaca specification at the error code and state machine level.

All test files use the `require_alpaca_error` helper to verify both the exception type and the specific error code:

```cpp
#include <alpacacore/util/error_handling.h>
#include <functional>

namespace {

void require_alpaca_error(const std::function<void()>& fn, int expected_code) {
    try {
        fn();
        FAIL("Expected AlpacaException");
    } catch (const alpacacore::AlpacaException& ex) {
        REQUIRE(ex.error_code() == expected_code);
    }
}

} // namespace
```

6. **ASCOM error codes** — verify the correct Alpaca error code, not just that it throws. ConformU checks error numbers, not exception messages.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Vendor Device - ASCOM Error Codes", "[vendor][device][unit]") {
    auto driver = create_vendor_device(0, 0);

    // Not connected must return NotConnected (0x407), not generic DriverException
    require_alpaca_error([&]() { driver->get_right_ascension(); },
                         alpacacore::AlpacaError::NotConnected);
    require_alpaca_error([&]() { driver->get_declination(); },
                         alpacacore::AlpacaError::NotConnected);

    // Invalid values must return InvalidValue (0x401)
    require_alpaca_error([&]() { driver->set_target_right_ascension(-0.1); },
                         alpacacore::AlpacaError::InvalidValue);
    require_alpaca_error([&]() { driver->set_target_declination(90.1); },
                         alpacacore::AlpacaError::InvalidValue);
}
```

7. **Value range validation** — invalid inputs must throw `InvalidValue` (0x401), not silently normalize or throw a generic error. Valid values must persist (set then get back).

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Vendor Telescope - Target Coordinate Persistence", "[vendor][telescope][unit]") {
    auto driver = create_vendor_telescope(0);

    REQUIRE_NOTHROW(driver->set_target_right_ascension(12.0));
    ALPACA_REQUIRE_APPROX(driver->get_target_right_ascension(), 12.0);

    REQUIRE_NOTHROW(driver->set_target_declination(45.0));
    ALPACA_REQUIRE_APPROX(driver->get_target_declination(), 45.0);

    // Changing one target must not affect the other
    REQUIRE_NOTHROW(driver->set_target_right_ascension(6.0));
    ALPACA_REQUIRE_APPROX(driver->get_target_right_ascension(), 6.0);
    ALPACA_REQUIRE_APPROX(driver->get_target_declination(), 45.0);
}
```

8. **State machine contracts** — verify that device state follows ASCOM rules without needing hardware.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("Vendor Camera - State Machine Contracts", "[vendor][camera][unit]") {
    auto driver = create_vendor_camera(0, 0);

    REQUIRE(driver->get_camera_state() == alpacacore::CameraState::Idle);
    REQUIRE(driver->get_is_pulse_guiding() == false);
    REQUIRE(driver->get_can_abort_exposure() == true);
    REQUIRE(driver->get_can_stop_exposure() == true);
}
```

### What's testable without hardware

Most ConformU checks can be replicated without hardware. The key is knowing which driver operations require a live connection and which don't.

**Testable without hardware (all device types):**
- All error codes (NotConnected, InvalidValue, NotImplemented)
- Capability flags (CanSlew, CanAbortExposure, etc.)
- Device metadata (Name, Description, InterfaceVersion)
- State machine initial state (Idle, not moving, not guiding)
- Unsupported action/method error codes

**Testable without hardware (telescope-specific):**
- Target coordinate range validation and persistence
- Site elevation validation ([-300, 10000] meters)
- Site latitude/longitude range validation
- Alignment mode and equatorial system values
- Tracking rates (non-empty list)
- Axis rate ranges
- Slew settle time validation

**Requires hardware:**
- Actual slew/move/exposure operations
- Position readback (RA, Dec, altitude, azimuth)
- Temperature readings
- Tracking state changes
- Image data capture
- Setting site latitude/longitude values (some drivers require connection)

### Device-type specific contracts

**Camera drivers** must also test:
- `CameraState` is `Idle` before first exposure
- `IsPulseGuiding` is false when idle
- `ImageReady` is false before any exposure (or throws NotConnected)
- `CanAbortExposure` and `CanStopExposure` are reportable

**Telescope drivers** must also test:
- Target RA/Dec range validation with `InvalidValue` error codes
- Target coordinate persistence (set, read back, verify independence)
- Site elevation range [-300, 10000] with `InvalidValue` for out-of-range
- Site latitude/longitude range validation
- `EquatorialSystem` returns a valid value
- `AlignmentMode` returns a valid value
- `TrackingRates` returns a non-empty list
- `SlewSettleTime` is non-negative, negative values throw `InvalidValue`
- Axis rate ranges for all three axes (tertiary should be empty)

**Focuser drivers** must also test:
- `Absolute` and `TempCompAvailable` are reportable
- `IsMoving` is false when idle
- All disconnected operations return `NotConnected` error code

Use `SKIP("reason")` when hardware isn't available. Tag hardware tests with `[hardware]`.

## Building drivers

AlpacaBridge drivers follow a **three-layer architecture**:

1. **Pure virtual interface** (`include/alpacacore/<device>_driver.h`) — already exists for all device types
2. **SDK/Protocol wrapper** (`include/alpacacore/vendor/<vendor>/`) — clean C++ interface wrapping the vendor SDK or serial protocol
3. **Vendor implementation** (`src/vendors/<vendor>/`) — concrete driver using the wrapper

SDK-based drivers (ZWO, QHY, Player One, SVBONY, ToupTek) use an **SDK wrapper**. Protocol-based drivers (iOptron, SynScan, Celestron, Gemini) use a **protocol wrapper**.

Use the [`/driver-build` skill](#driver-build--guided-driver-implementation) for the full interactive workflow — it walks through every step from SDK placement through ConformU validation. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for architecture rules and the [instruction index](agent-instructions.md) for vendor-specific lessons learned.

## Installing a source build as a service

```sh
./install_alpaca_service.sh install    # build + install systemd service
./install_alpaca_service.sh update     # rebuild + restart
./install_alpaca_service.sh uninstall  # remove service
./install_alpaca_service.sh status     # show status
```

For production use, prefer the apt package from [apt.openastro.net](https://apt.openastro.net).

## Packaging

The Debian package is built from the `debian/` directory. It installs:

- Binary at `/usr/bin/alpacabridge`
- Vendor libraries under `/usr/lib/alpacabridge`
- Configuration under `/etc/alpacabridge`
- Systemd unit `alpacabridge.service` running as the `alpacabridge` system user
- The software-update helper: root-owned oneshot unit `alpacabridge-update.service`, its script `/usr/libexec/alpacabridge/software-update`, and the polkit rule `/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/50-alpacabridge-update.rules` that lets the service user start that one unit (see [software-update.md](software-update.md)). `debian/rules` passes only `alpacabridge.service` to `dh_installsystemd` so the helper never gets enable/start/restart snippets.

## Releases

The only install channel is the OpenAstro APT repository ([apt.openastro.net](https://apt.openastro.net)): install once, then `apt upgrade`. Every version published there is also marked in this repository so a shipped build has a name:

- A git tag `vX.Y.Z` on the merge commit that carried the release (the `VERSION` file, the README badge, and the dated CHANGELOG heading all agree at that commit).
- A GitHub Release for that tag, created automatically by `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Its notes are the plain-language `docs/releases/X.Y.Z.md` (falling back to the version's CHANGELOG section) and its only assets are the source archives GitHub attaches itself. No `.deb` is attached; use apt.

To cut a release, run `/bump-release` (Claude Code skill, `.claude/commands/bump-release.md`). It does the whole flow: writes `VERSION`, updates the README badge and device count, assembles the changelog fragments into a dated CHANGELOG section, writes plain-language notes to `docs/releases/X.Y.Z.md`, opens and merges the release PR, tags the merge commit, and verifies the Release. By hand the same steps are:

1. On a `release/X.Y.Z` branch: write `VERSION`, update the README badge line, run `python3 scripts/changelog_fragments.py --release X.Y.Z --date <today>` (it writes the dated CHANGELOG section and deletes the `changelog.d/` fragments), and write `docs/releases/X.Y.Z.md` for the people who will not read the CHANGELOG (what changed, what to do, no issue numbers or code names).
2. Merge the PR.
3. Tag the merge commit and push the tag:

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The Release body is `docs/releases/X.Y.Z.md` with a link to the CHANGELOG section appended; when no notes file exists the CHANGELOG section itself is used. The workflow refuses a tag whose version does not match `VERSION`, or whose CHANGELOG section is missing or still `UNRELEASED`, so a tag can never publish notes for an uncut release. Preview the CHANGELOG notes locally with `scripts/changelog_section.py X.Y.Z`.

Testers who need an unreleased build still build from source or use `/deploy-remote-test`; commits between tags report the last released version.
