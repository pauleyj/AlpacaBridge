// parked keep-alive connection, plus their idle deadlines -- the same stall
// moved to a worse place. The probe settles after one successful read, so on
// a host with an RTC this costs nothing within a minute of start; on a host
// without one each pass is an opendir.
//
// The interval comes from Config (HostClock::kRtcProbeRateLimit + 1 s by
// default, deliberately not the limiter itself: equal periods race, and a
// pass landing a few microseconds early is silently swallowed, which would
// make the effective period 60 s). It is settable for the same reason the keep-alive
// cap is -- a test cannot wait half a minute to see the thread do its job.
//
// open-astro#547: this same thread also ticks the client-silence motion
// watchdog now (see the declaration's comment in server.h for why it rides
// here rather than spawning a thread per device). The loop wakes every
// kTimerTick (1 s, the watchdog's cadence) and calls
// Router::run_motion_watchdogs() on every pass; the RTC probe keeps its own,
// longer period via a separate deadline checked on each tick and re-armed
// from the probe time, so consecutive probes stay a full interval apart.
